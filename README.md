I find the Advent of Code puzzles fun! 

These are my Advent of Code 2023 submissions in TSQL. They might not be the most efficient, just the solution that worked. I tried to avoid loop or cursor as much as I can, have not succeeded in avoiding them altogether. 

Definitely not going for the leaderboard :) am still taking my time to solve the puzzles. And I've learned so much along the way.
